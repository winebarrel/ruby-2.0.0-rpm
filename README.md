# What is this spec?

Forked from imeyer's ruby-1.9.2-rpm project at https://github.com/imeyer/ruby-1.9.2-rpm and updated for 2.0.0.

This spec is an attempt to push for a stable replacement of Ruby 1.8.x with 1.9.2+ on RHEL based systems. The original author based it off of the work of [FrameOS](http://www.frameos.org) specs for Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby Enterprise Edition.
